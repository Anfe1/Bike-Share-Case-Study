# Bike-Share-Case-Study
This is a case study part of the google data analytics certification where we were tasked with analyzing bike-share data. For this project, I wanted to focus on writing python code to perform the analysis. The data looks into a year worth of entries regarding ride types, starting and ending times, and other minor information columns.
