# Bike-Share-Case-Study
This is a case study part of the google data analytics certification where we were tasked to perform some analysis regarding bike-share data. For this project I wanted to focus on writting python code to perform the analysis. The data looks into a year worth of entries regarding ride types, starting and endidng times and other minor columns.
